## Introduction
In this project, we explore a dataset containing anime ratings and apply data analysis techniques to gain insights into the data. We also implement two types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

## Dataset Summary
Provide a summary of the anime ratings dataset, including the number of records, columns, and any important details about the data.

## Merging the Anime Datasets
Explain the process of merging multiple anime datasets, if applicable, to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis and recommendation.

## Color Palette for Visualization
Describe the color palette chosen for visualizations in the project and its significance, if applicable.

## Top Anime Watched Based on Members
Showcase the top anime based on the number of members who have watched them, including visualizations and insights.

## Top Anime Category
Highlight the top anime categories or genres based on popularity or ratings, with supporting visualizations.

## Overall Anime Ratings
Present an overview of the overall anime ratings distribution, including mean, median, and other statistical measures.

## Top Anime Based on Rankings
Identify and present the top anime based on user rankings, with visualizations and insights.

## Category-wise Anime Ratings Distribution
Visualize the distribution of anime ratings across different categories or genres to identify trends and patterns.

## Anime Genres
Explore the different genres present in the anime dataset and analyze their frequency and popularity.

## Final Data Preprocessing
Explain the final steps of data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling ratings.

## Collaborative Recommender
Detail the implementation of the collaborative filtering recommender system, including the algorithms used and the steps involved.

## Content-Based Recommender
